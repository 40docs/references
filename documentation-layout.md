# Folder/File Hierarchy

The documentation follows a structured folder hierarchy to maintain organization and clarity. The layout is designed to categorize content based on organization, class, and individual labs or lessons.

## Folder Structure Overview

The folder hierarchy follows the pattern:

organization1/ └── class1/ └── lab1.md


The structure is flexible and can be expanded to include multiple organizations, classes, and labs as needed.

### Breakdown of Each Level

1. **`organization1/`**
   - This top-level folder represents the organization or group under which the documentation is categorized.
   - Example: `organization1/` could be replaced with a specific company name, institution, or department.

2. **`organization1/class1/`**
   - Each organization can have multiple classes or subjects, represented as subfolders.
   - `class1/` represents a particular class, course, or subject area.
   - Example: `class1/` could be named after a specific course code, subject name, or training module.

3. **`organization1/class1/lab1.md`**
   - The lowest level of the hierarchy contains individual documentation files for labs, lessons, or specific content pieces.
   - Each lab or lesson is saved as a `.md` file within the corresponding class folder.
   - Example: `lab1.md` could be replaced with a more descriptive file name like `introduction-to-git.md` or `lab-network-setup.md`.

## Example Layout with Multiple Classes and Labs

organization1/
├── class1/
│   ├── lab1.md
│   ├── lab2.md
│   └── lab3.md
└── class2/
    ├── lab1.md
    ├── lab2.md
    └── lab3.md

In this example:
- `organization1` contains two classes (`class1` and `class2`).
- Each class has multiple lab files (`lab1.md`, `lab2.md`, etc.).

## Guidelines for Adding New Content

1. **Create a new folder for each new organization:**  
   If a new organization needs to be added, create a new folder at the top level following the pattern `organization2/`.

2. **Add subfolders for each class under the organization:**  
   For each new class or subject, create a subfolder inside the respective organization's folder.

3. **Document individual labs or lessons in Markdown files:**  
   Each lab or lesson should be saved as a separate `.md` file inside the corresponding class folder. Use descriptive file names to improve readability.

## Example for Multiple Organizations

organization1/
├── class1/
│   ├── lab1.md
│   └── lab2.md
└── class2/
    ├── lab1.md
    └── lab2.md

organization2/
├── class1/
│   ├── lab1.md
│   ├── lab2.md
│   └── lab3.md
└── class3/
    └── lab1.md

With multiple organizations, each can have their own set of classes and labs organized in a similar hierarchy.

## Best Practices

- **Keep folder and file names concise but descriptive.**
- **Use lowercase letters and hyphens for file names to maintain consistency.**
- **Organize labs sequentially or by topic to facilitate navigation.**

This folder hierarchy helps keep documentation manageable and easy to navigate for different organizations, classes, and labs.
